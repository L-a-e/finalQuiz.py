Final Fantasy 7 Character Quiz 
https://github.com/L-a-e/finalQuiz.py.git 
This is a public repository used to commit progress and store history of the final project for ANGM 2305. 
This will be a quiz used to determine the personality of an individual through Final Fantasy 7 characters. 
They will be given multiple questions and the answers to those questions accumulate into points to determine an identity for the user. 

The planned features for the project is 20 questions with four multiple choice answers for each question. Th elist of characters an individual can recieve is 11.

The challenging part of this project is getting images to display after the user has gotten a result: "Your personality best suits Barret (Image is shown)" and creating a user interface that's intuitive and functional. 

20 questions and 4 answers eaxh with 11 characters total is the goal.
The minimal outcome would be 10 questions with 4 answers each and no images at all after the result. The artistic intent is to provide an enjoyable quiz for a user interesting in FF7 or learning about FF7.

Week 1: -Create the user interface using a plugin
        -Get all questions and answers written down
        -Add those to the interface regardless of functionality.

Week 2: - Create ability for the questions to store data of the user
        -The data needs to be used to add variables representing each character,
        for example: "Question here:" A.--> 2 points to Character 1 and 3 points to character 8
        -The quiz needs to contain the information in a way that doesn't allow for two of the same character to chosen. If the user gets a tie, the system needs to pick.

Week 3: -When the user gets a tie of two characters, the program chooses 1 option at       random, this is the easiest way to solve the problem.          
        -Images should be added when user gets result.
        -Bug fixes.
