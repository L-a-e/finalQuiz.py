Python Pixel Art Application

The goal of the project should have about eight different colors 
and four different pen sizes. 

It will use pygame to create a blank canvas that reads the users mouse imputs
while simultaneously implementing the color and pen size they chose.

I would like to add two more colors if possible, and also create a real time drawing during a recording.
At worst, the program would remain with 4 colors and 2 special buttons: "Erase" and "Clear."

Week 1
        -Create the blank canvas and have it be white
        -Allow for mouse imputs to be recognized by user
        -Create a black and white grid to give the user a guide for making pixel art.
Week 2 
        -add different colors 
        -add different brush sizes
Week 3
        -bug test
        -frame rate limitatioins: getting the program to track th espeed of the brush more efficiently.
